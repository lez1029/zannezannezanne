*How Tinkerbell got into Disney*

 Once upon a time, there was a girl named tinkerbell. 
 One day, she felt like eating some prata and decided to go to the market to find some dough. 
 Then, she bought some dough from Rapunzel.
 However, she needed some flour. However, she forgot her spectacles. 
 Then she thought magic flying dust was the roti prata flour.
 Then she bought it. Then she went home and whipped, whipped and whipped the dough!
 With that, she sprinkled 10 spoonfuls of flying dust.
 Then she went to fry it and ate it. Suddenly, she turned super small and could fly. 
 She became a small cute fairy.
 As she finished her homework, she went for a Disney audition and managed to get a role with Peter Pan. They had many many shows together and lived happily ever after with their friends.
 The End.
