 On her way there, she met Rapunzel. Then, she talked to her for a while and noticed that Rapunzel has the ingredients she needed. 
 "Do you have any extra ingredients for me?" Tinkerbell asked.
 "Yes of course!" Rapunzel spilt all the ingredients that Tinkerbell needed and gave it to Tinkerbell. 
 She went back home happily. 
 She went home and whip and whip and whip the ingredients. 
 She sprinkled 10 spoonfulls of flour.
 Then she went to fry it and ate it. Then, she suddenly grew small and grew wings.
